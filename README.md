# Self Critique

Analyzing a website and creating a newly designed one based on it helped me understand the user side of web development. I think I now have a strong grasp on html, css, and even javascript. However, when I attempted to create a hamburger menu, it did not work out in the end. There are definitely some html and css elements I would like to work on. I worked on the add/drop page along with a validation javascript. I also helped a lot with other pages so that it passes validation and had no other visible problems.

Everyone definitely put a lot of work into this project. We first split the work where each person did a specific page which also included the css and javascript. 

Sara focused on the login page. She also did a lot of the css with the footer and helped get us started with the project in terms of css. She helped with validation and other problems on other pages. 

Chris focused on the academics page. He also did the javascript for the login page to allow for specific username and password combinations. Definitely showed a lot of improvement and progress as time went on.

Ian focused on the home page. He also created a navbar so we could navigate between pages. In addition, he also did work on mediaqueries and fixing things like validation errors.

Jacob focused on the pin page. Also put a lot of effort into creating a pin validation but unfortunately was not successful. Despite all of our work (css) being divided and unorganized, he condensed it into one working css file.
